# small
A minimal, elegant and small programming language for the 21st century.

##install
git clone the contents then do this to make it an executable

        cp ~/pysmall/small.py /usr/bin/small
        chmod +x ~/pysmall/small  (or whatever your path is)
That way you can run it like this

        small example.sl
        instead of
        python small.py example.sl

##syntax
small uses only 3 commands.

    "+", "," and "."

"+" is for addition.
"," is for a 1 char input.
"." is for an ascii print of the number.

##License
small is licensed under the GPLv3 because I want stallman to accept my cries for help.
